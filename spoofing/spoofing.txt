Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is that the session information stored in the client-side cookie lacks security, leaving it vulnerable to attacks like request forging.

In the secure version, the secret key is retrieved from a command-line argument instead of hardcoded, keeping the secret key out of the source code. Also it sets the httpOnly flag
to true, which ensures that the session cookie cannot be accessed via client-side scripts.
