The vulnerability in the initial code is related to user data storage where the username is stored in the session without any sanitization, allowing an attacker
to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the user's name, which would be stored.
In the secure version, escapeHTML prevents special HTML characters in the user input, ensuring that any potentially malicious code is neutralized.
